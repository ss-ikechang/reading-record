### 3.1: Strategies

- 1: Expansion
  - 質問に対して、展開した答えを述べたほうが良い
  - そうすることで、あなたが質問をよく理解していることと、言語能力の高さを示せる
  - 質問例: Do you like riding bicycles?
    - 悪い答え: Yes
    - より良い答え: Yes, because it's fun, good for health, and doesn't cost a lot.
    - 優れた答え
      - Well, I like to ride bikes for a few reasons. **The main reason** I like to cycle is that I think it is really fun and it is a good way to go sightseeing. **I'd also like to point-out** that riding a bike is very good for my health because it can help me to lose weight. **I would also like to add** that recently I haven't been riding my bike much, as I am quite busy at work.
  - 答えを展開するために利用できるやり方
    - 1: Dividing your response into 2 or 3 parts
    - 2: Explaining something from general terms to specific and maybe giving and example
    - 3: Depends - describing different situations
    - 4: Concession - making a main argument and then giving a concession to it
    - 5: Avoidance - not directly answering the question at first and then answering it
- 2: Show language
  - 質問例: What colors do you like?
    - 悪い答え: I like and green and blue.
    - より良い答え: My favorite colors are light green and navy blue.
      - より正確に表現することで、語彙の評価を上げられる
    - 優れた答え
      - Well, My favorite color is **magenta**, I guess that's because I'm really into bright and bold colors. I also like **turquoise**, I find that a very relaxing peaceful color that reminds me of the ocean.
      - あまり一般的でない色を答えることで、語彙を示せる
      - "I'm really into" のような慣用的な表現も、表現力を示せる
- 3: Buy time to think
  - 特定のやり方を繰り返し使うべきではない
  - Repeat the question
    - "Oh, so you're asking about my favorite color." のように繰り返すことで考える時間を作る
  - Ask the examiner to repeat the question
    - 試験官は 1 度だけ、問題を復唱できる
    - 復唱を 1 度行ってもらってもスコアは下がらないが、何度も行ってしまうとスコアを下げる
    - "I'm sorry I didn't quite catch that ... could you please repeat the question."
  - 答え始めに使える表現
    - Well, that's a really interesting question
    - Oh I'm not too sure about that ... Let me think for a minute ... Oh yes it is ...
    - With regards to your question, I guess I would have to say that ...
- 4: If you don't understand the question
  - わからない単語については試験官に説明をお願いできる。しかし質問全体について rephrase をお願いすることはできない(part3 を除く)
  - 質問がわからなかった場合、黙ってしまうのが一番良くない
  - 聞き取れたキーワードから、質問に対する答えを返すようにする
