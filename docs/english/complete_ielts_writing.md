Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to ask if you would be so kind as to give me some details about your hotel's accomodation.

I would like to book accomodation for my family and I from the 11th of March until the 15th. On the 11th I would like to arrive late in the afternoon, and on the 15th, if possible, I would like to have a late check-out at about 4 pm.

As we are two adults and a child, I would like to book a one-bedroom suite, if possible. I would also prefer a non-smoking room as my daughter has allergies. Please, let me know how much it would be for the entire length of our stay and also whether the price includes anything extra like breakfast.

I would also appreciate any information you can offer about places for sightseeing and leisure activities as we will be spending a few days in the town nearby.

Thank you in advance for your kind cooperation.

Yours faithfully,
Mike Wattie

解答例

Dear Mrs. Brown,

The purpose of this letter is to express my opinion about your magazine. I believe it is a wonderful idea to ask for the thoughts of your readers about your recently released publication.

I purchased the magazine because it includes topics that relate to my hobby of bird watching. I often seek out new places to visit to take photos of birds and your magazine seems to provide lots of good recommendations.

What I loved the most about your current issue was the article describing places to go bird watching in local national parks. I especially like the way you covered the latest developments in the parks that support birdwatchers. Moreover, I felt attracted by the images portrayed on the cover page.

I would like to suggest you to continue producing material which is useful and enjoyable to read. Also, I suggest that you make the magazine more concise and with fewer images so it is lighter and even more appealing.

I hope you find my comments and recommendations helpful.

Yours sincerely,
Mike Wattie

解答例

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with a product I purchased recently from one of your stores.

I recently bought a Samsung self-defrosting refrigerator from your store on Grote St. in Adelaide. I paid cash for it and it was delivered to my house on the 11th of June. The model number is G11412, and it is shown on page 27 of your spring catalogue.

There is a problem with the defrosting system of the refrigerator. Every time, the refrigerator defrosts itself, a puddle of water forms on the floor in front of it. This is both a nuisance and a danger as someone may slip and fall.

I hope this matter will receive your immediate attention. Please contact me during the day on my mobile 094-980-2675 to arrange a time for a repair man to fix the defrost system.

Thank you in advance for your help in straightening out this matter.

Yours faithfully,
Mike Wattie

解答例

Dear Mr and Mrs Smith,

I am writing to sincerely apologise for the disturbance caused during my birthday party last Saturday night.

I was celebrating my 25th birthday with my friends and approximately two hours after the party started, two people, who were friends of a friend, started arguing about an issue that is still unknown to me. Initially, it was just a discussion, but then it became a fight and I was forced to call the police.

I deeply regret having interrupted your sleep. Please accept my most sincere apologies. The situation got out of control and noise at that point was inevitable. However, I understand that we all enjoy living in a peaceful neighbourhood and whatever happened at my party should not have disturbed you.

I will refrain from holding parties in my unit in the future in order to avoid further problematic events in our residental area.

Once again, my apologies for the inconvenience caused.

Kind regards,
Mike Wattie

解答例

Dear Peter,

It seems like ages since we were together at university. I am writing to express my gratitude for remembering my birthday.

I felt really excited when I found a parcel from you in my letter box. I was really touched that you have still kept in touch and what's more, you remembered my birthdday. It really makes me feel we have a close and special friendship despite the physical distance between us.

When I opened up the box and I found that you had sent a bottle of my favourite maple syrup I was really happy. As you know I just love that sweet syrup and I also liked the oak casket that it was packaged in.

Every Sunday, I am going to pour some of the syrup over my pancakes. I might also make some of those maple syrup toffees I used to make when we were flatmates.

Once again I really appreciated you remembering my birthday.

Cheers,
Mike

解答例 1: somewhat agree の場合

Many people feel that family life is being harmed by the high-speed and pressure of contemporary lifestyles. *I somewhat agree with this opinion* because the fast pace leads to less time for families to be together, and stress leads to arguments among family members; however, due to the increased time pressure and stress families are forced to cooperate more, which brings them closer together.

*The main reason why I believe* family life is being compromised is because families have less time to be with each other. As individual family members are busier at work and with their social lives, they have less time to spend with their family. As well as this, people have many things they have to do these days such as checking e-mail, updating their online social status and so less time is left for family life. To illustrate, I spend about two hours online every night attending to daily correspondence before chatting with my family members.

*In addition,* the pressure of life these days means that even when families do get together arguments are more likely. This is because everyone feels tired and they are more likely to get irritated and to react to their heightened emotional levels.

*However,* it does seem reasonable that this pressure may also lead to positive outcomes in some families. One such possibility is that family members will cooperate more in order to overcome time limitations. For instance, they may share household chores, so that everybody has time to relax afterwards.

*In conclusion,* *I somewhat believe* that the rapid pace and stressful nature of contemporary lifestyles are having negative consequences on family relationships. This is because family members have less time, and when they are together they feel less relaxed. However, I admit that sometimes adversity can bring people closer together. Given this situation, it seems that family members should try to be more supportive to one another and also parents need to set aside regular times for families to relax together.

*There is currently a contentious argument over whether* family life is being harmed by the high-speed and pressure of contemporary lifestyles. *I totally agree with this opinion because* the fast pace leads to less time for families to be together, and stress leads to arguments among family members.

*The main reason why I believe* family life is being compromised is because families have less time to be with each other.

As well as this, people have many things they have to do these days such as checking e-mail, updating their online social status and so less time is left for family life. To illustrate, I spend about two hours online every night attending to daily correspondence before chatting with my family members, whereas ten years ago I would spend time with my family as soon as I walked in the door.

*Another reason why I supported the notion that* families are being impacted negatively is that the pressure of life these days mean that even when families do get together arguments are more likely. This is because everyone feels tired and they are more likely to get irritated and to react to their heightened emotional levels.

*In conclusion, I completely agree that* the rapid pace and stressful nature of contemporary lifestyles are having negative consequences on family relationships.

解答例 3: outweigh の場合

例題

Many people believe that the government should encourage industries and business to move from large cities to the countryside.
Do you think that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?

解答

Nowadays, there is a contentious issue regarding whether the authorities should provide incentives for factories and other companies to relocate from metropolitan areas to rural sites. In my opinion, the merits outweigh the drawbacks.

There are *considerable benefits* to locating companies in regional areas. For businesses themselves, they can have a significant decline in costs, such as the leases on premises, which are usually dramatically higher in the big cities. It is also likely to benefit rural communities by boosting their economies and providing job opportunities in the neighbourhood and preventing the need for them to make a long commute to work in the city. Finally, by locating businesses in remote areas it can benefit cities by reducing overcrowding, traffic congestion, and pollution levels.

However, there are *potential drawbacks* to companies and businesses moving their premises outside metropolises. The main issue is that companies located in regional areas may be further away from their employees. This can make it more difficult to find labour to work in the company. As well as this, the companies may be located further away from their customers, which might weaken their relationships with their customers.

In conclusion, the merits to businesses relocating in more remote areas seem to outweigh the drawbacks as it can benefit the companies themselves, the local communities, and also the metropolitan areas. However, companies may face challenges to find labour and maintain close relationships with their customres. Given this situation, it seems that the government should offer incentives to encourage companies to relocate to the countryside.

Many people feel that getting pupils ready for their careers should be the main focus of schools, whereas others believe that schools should have additional purposes. The purpose of this essay is to analyse both sides of this argument and then I will explain why I believe the view that schools should have other functions is stronger.

There are merits of schools only focusing on preparing young people for their working lives. If young people are better prepared for their careers, they will be more successful in their working lives. As well as this, they will also make more money and be able to support themselves better. To illustrate, some recent stories in the media highlighted that students who finish high school are less likely to be unemployed, and more likely to earn higher salaries. In addition, by schools preparing young people for jobs, there will be a better-prepared workforce. This benefits society by raising productivity and ensuring that employers have the necessary labour they need.

However, there are also advantages of schools having other functions. First of all, they should teach students skills to make them well-rounded. By teaching communication skills and how to use technology, the students will be better-rounded individuals. Clearly, these are important skills in today's society and so they should be learnt at school. As well as this, schools should teach morals and ethics because this will make the society better. Many people feel that this aspect of schooling has become neglected, and has led to a deterioration of society.

In conclusion, *I believe* both sides of the argument have their merits. On balance, however, it seems that schools should have other functions. This is because if the student are well rounded, they will be more successful in their lives and contribute more to society.

Some people believe that there should be the death penalty for extremely serious crimes. Other believe that it is not morally correct to kill criminals.
Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.

解答

A highly controversial issue today relates to whether to have *capital punishment* or not. In this essay, I am going to examine this question from both points of view and then give my own opinion on the matter.

There are people who argue that the benifits of *killing violent criminals* considerably outweigh its disadvantages. The main reason for believing this is that *the fear of execution acts as a deterrent to commit serious crimes such as rape and murder*. It is also possible to say that *the execution of a criminal may bring relief to the suffering victims*. One good illustration of this is *when Saddam Hussein was executed. Many of the victims who were persecuted under his rule expressed joy and relief when he was finally captured and killed*.

On the other hand, it is also possible to make the opposing case. It is often argued that *sentencing criminals to death is just committing another murder*. People often have this opinion because *they think that it is immoral to take another person's life, no matter what the reason is*. A second point is that *many religions are opposed to any form of murder*. A particularly good example here is *from the bible, which lists killing another person as one of the Ten Commandments that should not be broken*.

In conclusion, I believe both arguments have their merits. On balance, however, I feel that *capital punishment is justified*. This is because *in cases of extreme crime and that deterring crime is more important than taking the moral high ground*.

例題

In the future many change will occur and many people that will improve our society.
Do you agree or disagree?
What kind of changes will occur?

解答

As a result of developments that are taking place, many people believe that life will become better. This essay discusses the reasons why the changes that are coming are positive, and also suggests what kind of changes will occur.

The changes that are coming are positive for two main reasons. The main reason is that they will make our lives more convenient. We are likely to have more free time as a result of technology taking over many of our everyday tasks. For example, we may have robots capable of doing many household chores, and this will enable us to have more free time for enjoyment and relaxation. Another factor is that our recreational time will be enhanced by new technologies that make our entertainment even more fun. If we enjoy ourselves more we will be happier and more relaxed.

There are two main types of developments that are likely to occur. The first of these is time-saving technologies. Future enhancements of robotics are likely to lead to even more household tasks being performed by machines. As well as this, the entertainment industry looks likely to soon make enhancements to our recrational experiences by making new technologies available. A good example of this is 3-D television, which will make watching movies more fun.

In conclusion, the future looks promising because we will have technology takeover many of life's mundane tasks and we'll have better forms of entertainment. The most likely changes appear to be technologies to save us time and also enhance our leisure time. This means that we are likely to have more time for relaxation and better ways to spend it.

The use of illegal drugs, such as heroin and cocaine, are becoming more and more common in many countries.
What are some of the problems associated with drug abuse, and what are some of the possible solutions?

解答

*Drug abuse* is becoming increasingly serious in many nations. Although *drugs* threaten[s] many societies, its/their effects can also be combated successfully. This essay looks at some of the problems caused by *drug use* on society, and suggests some solutions to the problems.

*Drug abuse* causes multiple problems for countries and communities. The *medical* effects are very obvious. For example, *addicts abuse their bodies and neglect their health, and so eventually require expensive treatment or hospitalization*. In some cases, such as *Marilyn Monroe*, a *drug overdose* even leads to *death*. The second effect is *crime*. People who *take drugs* become *crazy and irrational and often cause harm and danger to themselves and others*.

However, the menace of *drugs* can be fought. Education is the main way to tackle this issue. People need to be aware of the effects so that they can avoid this problem. In addition, the government could also *use infomercials to educate their citizens*. This is a good approach because *they can alert all citizens about the negative aspects of using drugs*.

In conclusion, *drug abuse* is a serious issue because it causes harmful effects on people's health and people who are *high often commit crimes*. The best approaches to deal with it are to educate people about its damaging effects, and also for the government *to ensure all people are aware of the consequences through public service advertising*. Although the problem is unlikely to be entirely eliminated in the short term there are concrete steps to reduce the effects it is having on the current society.
