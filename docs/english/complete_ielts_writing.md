Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to ask if you would be so kind as to give me some details about your hotel's accomodation.

I would like to book accomodation for my family and I from the 11th of March until the 15th. On the 11th I would like to arrive late in the afternoon, and on the 15th, if possible, I would like to have a late check-out at about 4 pm.

As we are two adults and a child, I would like to book a one-bedroom suite, if possible. I would also prefer a non-smoking room as my daughter has allergies. Please, let me know how much it would be for the entire length of our stay and also whether the price includes anything extra like breakfast.

I would also appreciate any information you can offer about places for sightseeing and leisure activities as we will be spending a few days in the town nearby.

Thank you in advance for your kind cooperation.

Yours faithfully,
Mike Wattie

解答例

Dear Mrs. Brown,

The purpose of this letter is to express my opinion about your magazine. I believe it is a wonderful idea to ask for the thoughts of your readers about your recently released publication.

I purchased the magazine because it includes topics that relate to my hobby of bird watching. I often seek out new places to visit to take photos of birds and your magazine seems to provide lots of good recommendations.

What I loved the most about your current issue was the article describing places to go bird watching in local national parks. I especially like the way you covered the latest developments in the parks that support birdwatchers. Moreover, I felt attracted by the images portrayed on the cover page.

I would like to suggest you to continue producing material which is useful and enjoyable to read. Also, I suggest that you make the magazine more concise and with fewer images so it is lighter and even more appealing.

I hope you find my comments and recommendations helpful.

Yours sincerely,
Mike Wattie

解答例

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with a product I purchased recently from one of your stores.

I recently bought a Samsung self-defrosting refrigerator from your store on Grote St. in Adelaide. I paid cash for it and it was delivered to my house on the 11th of June. The model number is G11412, and it is shown on page 27 of your spring catalogue.

There is a problem with the defrosting system of the refrigerator. Every time, the refrigerator defrosts itself, a puddle of water forms on the floor in front of it. This is both a nuisance and a danger as someone may slip and fall.

I hope this matter will receive your immediate attention. Please contact me during the day on my mobile 094-980-2675 to arrange a time for a repair man to fix the defrost system.

Thank you in advance for your help in straightening out this matter.

Yours faithfully,
Mike Wattie

解答例

Dear Mr and Mrs Smith,

I am writing to sincerely apologise for the disturbance caused during my birthday party last Saturday night.

I was celebrating my 25th birthday with my friends and approximately two hours after the party started, two people, who were friends of a friend, started arguing about an issue that is still unknown to me. Initially, it was just a discussion, but then it became a fight and I was forced to call the police.

I deeply regret having interrupted your sleep. Please accept my most sincere apologies. The situation got out of control and noise at that point was inevitable. However, I understand that we all enjoy living in a peaceful neighbourhood and whatever happened at my party should not have disturbed you.

I will refrain from holding parties in my unit in the future in order to avoid further problematic events in our residental area.

Once again, my apologies for the inconvenience caused.

Kind regards,
Mike Wattie

解答例

Dear Peter,

It seems like ages since we were together at university. I am writing to express my gratitude for remembering my birthday.

I felt really excited when I found a parcel from you in my letter box. I was really touched that you have still kept in touch and what's more, you remembered my birthdday. It really makes me feel we have a close and special friendship despite the physical distance between us.

When I opened up the box and I found that you had sent a bottle of my favourite maple syrup I was really happy. As you know I just love that sweet syrup and I also liked the oak casket that it was packaged in.

Every Sunday, I am going to pour some of the syrup over my pancakes. I might also make some of those maple syrup toffees I used to make when we were flatmates.

Once again I really appreciated you remembering my birthday.

Cheers,
Mike

解答例 1: somewhat agree の場合

Many people feel that family life is being harmed by the high-speed and pressure of contemporary lifestyles. *I somewhat agree with this opinion* because the fast pace leads to less time for families to be together, and stress leads to arguments among family members; however, due to the increased time pressure and stress families are forced to cooperate more, which brings them closer together.

*The main reason why I believe* family life is being compromised is because families have less time to be with each other. As individual family members are busier at work and with their social lives, they have less time to spend with their family. As well as this, people have many things they have to do these days such as checking e-mail, updating their online social status and so less time is left for family life. To illustrate, I spend about two hours online every night attending to daily correspondence before chatting with my family members.

*In addition,* the pressure of life these days means that even when families do get together arguments are more likely. This is because everyone feels tired and they are more likely to get irritated and to react to their heightened emotional levels.

*However,* it does seem reasonable that this pressure may also lead to positive outcomes in some families. One such possibility is that family members will cooperate more in order to overcome time limitations. For instance, they may share household chores, so that everybody has time to relax afterwards.

*In conclusion,* *I somewhat believe* that the rapid pace and stressful nature of contemporary lifestyles are having negative consequences on family relationships. This is because family members have less time, and when they are together they feel less relaxed. However, I admit that sometimes adversity can bring people closer together. Given this situation, it seems that family members should try to be more supportive to one another and also parents need to set aside regular times for families to relax together.

解答例 2: totally agree の場合

*There is currently a contentious argument over whether* family life is being harmed by the high-speed and pressure of contemporary lifestyles. *I totally agree with this opinion because* the fast pace leads to less time for families to be together, and stress leads to arguments among family members.

*The main reason why I believe* family life is being compromised is because families have less time to be with each other.

As well as this, people have many things they have to do these days such as checking e-mail, updating their online social status and so less time is left for family life. To illustrate, I spend about two hours online every night attending to daily correspondence before chatting with my family members, whereas ten years ago I would spend time with my family as soon as I walked in the door.

*Another reason why I supported the notion that* families are being impacted negatively is that the pressure of life these days mean that even when families do get together arguments are more likely. This is because everyone feels tired and they are more likely to get irritated and to react to their heightened emotional levels.

*In conclusion, I completely agree that* the rapid pace and stressful nature of contemporary lifestyles are having negative consequences on family relationships.

解答例 3: outweigh の場合

例題

Many people believe that the government should encourage industries and business to move from large cities to the countryside.
Do you think that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?

解答

Nowadays, there is a contentious issue regarding whether the authorities should provide incentives for factories and other companies to relocate from metropolitan areas to rural sites. In my opinion, the merits outweigh the drawbacks.

There are *considerable benefits* to locating companies in regional areas. For businesses themselves, they can have a significant decline in costs, such as the leases on premises, which are usually dramatically higher in the big cities. It is also likely to benefit rural communities by boosting their economies and providing job opportunities in the neighbourhood and preventing the need for them to make a long commute to work in the city. Finally, by locating businesses in remote areas it can benefit cities by reducing overcrowding, traffic congestion, and pollution levels.

However, there are *potential drawbacks* to companies and businesses moving their premises outside metropolises. The main issue is that companies located in regional areas may be further away from their employees. This can make it more difficult to find labour to work in the company. As well as this, the companies may be located further away from their customers, which might weaken their relationships with their customers.

In conclusion, the merits to businesses relocating in more remote areas seem to outweigh the drawbacks as it can benefit the companies themselves, the local communities, and also the metropolitan areas. However, companies may face challenges to find labour and maintain close relationships with their customres. Given this situation, it seems that the government should offer incentives to encourage companies to relocate to the countryside.
